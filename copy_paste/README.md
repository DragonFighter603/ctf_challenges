# Copy Paste: Self-Cloning python code
(..)[back]
##### Type `challenge`
##### Lang `python`	
##### Tags `self replicate`, `clone`

## Task
Create a program in python (or any language of your choice) that prints it's own source code.
The program MAY NOT:
- read the content of it's own source file at runtime
- use a macro or compile time directive to include its own source code as a string
  
=> It should run independant of a file system, aka should be executable in an online compiler/nterpreter.

## Requirements
- The program may be nonempty
- The printed string should be 1:1 the input string
- You should be able to copy-paste the output to a file, compile/run it, repeat indefinetly
